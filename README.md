Okay, what should I do? Stay tuned!

Hi! Here we go again. It is the second day of my GitHub journey. Recently I do not have a specific project, but I write here.

Currently I am writing and listening to videos on YouTube about willpower because I have a problemm with my my diet. I do not want to write about this here, but it is the firstirst repo.

This video said,, Do not think about what  want to do. Just do it, becausese thinking about what  want to do everything hard. So do not think a lot and just do it. 

I know its not normal to write somethingething here. Okay, I know, but Iut I love it,, and that is okay.

Okay,, let's come back to this video,, which said,, Just do it for 21 21 days,, and thereafter, you have the power to finish everything you do." II don't know if if that is true or not, but I wantto try. 

Tomorrow is #17 Farvardin,, so I want to start a newew journey in diet. and want to cut sugar and white bread. 

So let's do it, and if I have a cheat meal in these days, I mean between 21 days, I should start again.
