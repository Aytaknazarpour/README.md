Hi!Here we go again. it is second day of my github journey. recently I do not have a specific project, but i write here.
Currently I writing and listening to videos in YouTube about willpower, cause have  problem with diet. i do not want to write about this here, but it is first Repo.
This video said do not think about what do you want to do. just do it, cause thinking about what do you want to do, that makes hard everything. so do not think a lot and just do it.
